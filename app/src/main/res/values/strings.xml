<!--        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"-->

<!--        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."-->
<!--        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "-->
<!--        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"-->
<!--        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "-->
<!--        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "-->
<!--        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "-->
<!--        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"-->
<!--        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "-->
<!--        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "-->
<!--        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"-->

<!--        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "-->
<!--        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "-->
<!--        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "-->
<!--        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "-->
<!--        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"-->
<!--        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "-->
<!--        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "-->
<!--        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"-->
<!--        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "-->
<!--        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"-->
<!--        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "-->
<!--        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"-->

<!--        "3D world.\n\n"-->

<!--        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "-->
<!--        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "-->
<!--        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "-->
<!--        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"-->
<!--        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "-->
<!--        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Light and shadow.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "-->
<!--        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"-->
<!--        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "-->
<!--        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "-->
<!--        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "-->
<!--        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Resting elevation.\n\n"-->

<!--        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "-->
<!--        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "-->
<!--        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Component elevations.\n\n"-->

<!--        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "-->
<!--        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"-->
<!--        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "-->
<!--        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"-->

<!--        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "-->
<!--        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "-->
<!--        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"-->
<!--        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "-->
<!--        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "-->
<!--        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "-->
<!--        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"-->
<!--        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "-->
<!--        "elevation.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"-->

<!--        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "-->
<!--        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "-->
<!--        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "-->
<!--        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"-->
<!--        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "-->
<!--        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "-->
<!--        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"-->
<!--        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "-->
<!--        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "-->
<!--        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"-->
